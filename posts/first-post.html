    <h1>First Post</h2>
    <p>
        Writing stuff sucks.<br>
        I may be saying this just because it is my first log, but what am I supposed to share.<br>
        Am I required to have perfect grammar here or can I make as many <u style="text-decoration-color: crimson; text-decoration-style: wavy;">mitsakes</u> as possible?<br>
        Do I have to write a clever an witty sentence that the reader will never forget?<br>
        And how do I not cringe when I look back at this mess.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        While making this website I stumbled upon many other websites and tools that I liked the design of which I wanted to share and possibly will make a collection of, soonâ„¢.<br>
        I have to add a whole lot of stuff to the website till it is to my liking.
        <ul>
            <li>Guestbook - I would love to code up a guestbook on my own, but since this website is hosted on github pages I can't</li>
            <li>A Vistor Counter would be fucking cool</li>
            <li>Wordle - On the sidebar in the homepage would be lovely. That, I can do within the confines of github.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        Originally, I wanted to make a sick ass website like <a href="https://lovesick.cafe" target="_blank">lovesick.cafe</a> but even making this bland site took me a lot of time (3 days wasted just to get to a log.)
        <br>

    <p>
        Infact Neocities as a whole made me jealous. Just look at any website in the <a href="https://neocities.org/browse" target="_blank">browse</a> section.
        <br>HOW CAN THEY MAKE SUCH EXQUISITE WEBSITES?? I never knew it was possible to even do this with CSS, plain old CSS!
        <br>
        Even the ugliest website there is better than this.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's all I had on my mind, see you whenever suckers
